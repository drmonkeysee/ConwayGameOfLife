# Conway Game of Life

HTML scaffolding for implementing Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.

## What do I do?

**index.html** provides a simple Game of Life cell grid and a set of UI controls. The grid can be painted upon to set live and dead cells.

There are basic utility methods `gol.utility.markCell()` and `gol.utility.clearCell()` to set and clear cell state. Everything else is up to you!
